# PainScope

Painscope is designed to help you deal with managing your chronic pain journey.

PainScope is a simple tracking tool you can use to record where and when pain strikes. You’ll be able to share this information with your medical support team in a concrete and easy-to-read format.

Supporting features like journaling, identifying behaviours that might trigger your condition, and (future) integration with wearable devices will assist you in talking about the pain with your medical practitioner.

## Getting Started

### Required Environment / Minimum Setup

Download the PainScope app from the Apple Store.

## Walkthrough

### Welcome

The Welcome page has buttons you can click to Log in and Sign Up. Swipe through for a quick tour of the features: Record, Chart, Query, Communicate, Manage.

### Sign Up

To create an account for the first time, sign up with the following information: Username, Age, Gender, Email Address, Password. You have the option to set a Reminder Frequency if you would like the app to check in with you and prompt you to record your pain level.

### Log in

Sign in using your password to record your pain and access your data.

### Greeting

Once logged in, you choose whether you are logging your overall health status or if you are feeling pain.

### Record My Pain

#### My pain description

You can describe your pain using the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) scale. Scroll through the list of descriptive words.

#### My pain location

Tap on the area of the body of the picture where you feel the pain. There are also tabs for External and Internal body parts to allow you to narrow down where you feel the pain.

#### My pain intensity

You can record the intensity of the pain using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

#### My sleep

The quality of your sleep has a big impact on your health. You can record these measurements manually or by connection to a wearable device.

#### My biometrics

If you are wearing a wearable monitor like a FitBit, you can keep a record of all your other health-related information.

#### My data

When you have submitted your log, you can view it over a Day, Week or Month, and you can also view the summary on a calendar format. You can share this with your doctor during the consultation, or keep it for your own records.

### Query

When preparing for your next doctor’s appointment, you may have a list of questions about your condition. There is a list of default questions available, or you can write your own.

### Communicate

My Consultation gathers all the information you need when you are talking to your doctor. At the click of a button, you are able to see your data over a given number of days and the list of questions you would like to ask your doctor. You can also share this data in a way that suits you.

### Manage

My Management Plan is a place to store the information about your diagnosis, treatment plans and appointment schedules to keep your journey to better health on track.
